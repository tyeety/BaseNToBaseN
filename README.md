# BaseNToBaseN
Easily convert any length of number from any base to any base (currently maximum base is 583, can get increased easily)
Used 1 byte length characters for maximum base 92, and 2 byte length characters for maximum base 583. Feel free to modify it and generate more characters without limitation using generator() function, to increase maximum base limit.
